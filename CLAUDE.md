# What is this project

This is a website I have for my personal projects, games, apps etc.
There's a special app inside this website that I use with my wife for tracking our Crossfit workouts
shets that our Coach provides us in PDF.

I'll ask you every new period (sometimes its weekly, sometimes biweekly, sometimes monthly, it varies a lot)
to populate our workouts.

RULE FOR POPULATING WORKOUTS:
- Pay attetion to the date I'm telling you to start populating - I'll tell you which day of month/year is the "Monday" / "Segunda" in portuguese.
- Always remove the "COACH GUTO GIORDANI" during the import
- If you see any typo or mistake like my coach always spell "Unbroaken" instead of "Unbroken" - fix it.
